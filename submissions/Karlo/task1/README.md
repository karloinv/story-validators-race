## Karlo validator

I am an individual validator from Ukraine.

I have been in the crypto ecosystem since about 2021 and for one and a half of them I worked for a staking provider. 

I worked in such ecosystems as Near and Polkadot. But still, I spent most of my time in the Cosmos ecosystem.  In the company, I maintained the infrastructure (including validators) for such projects as Lava, Initia, Dymension, Celestia, Nibiru, Althea, Archway, Haqq, Band, Sge, and others.

I can highlight my main skills when working with nodes:
- Maintenance of archive infrastructure.
- Maintenance of Hermes IBC.
- Launch a sentry nodes, own seed nodes...
- Setup Horcrux.
- Launch from the first block of genesis.

I don't have validator services and active validators in other projects yet. I am working on it. The website is coming soon and I hope Story will take the first place in my portfolio there.
